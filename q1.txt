	Command: allv24:~> perl -v
	This is perl 5, version 20, subversion 2 (v5.20.2) built for x86_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi

b. 
	Command: allv24:~> perldoc perlrun
	
c. 
	Command: allv24:~> perldoc perlfunc

d. 
	Command: allv24:~> perldoc -f map

e. 
	Command: allv24:~> perldoc perlvar
	Description: When referenced, $! retrieves the current value of the C
               "errno" integer variable.  If $! is assigned a numerical value,
               that value is stored in "errno".  When referenced as a string,
               $! yields the system error string corresponding to "errno".

               Many system or library calls set "errno" if they fail, to
               indicate the cause of failure.  They usually do not set "errno"
               to zero if they succeed.  This means "errno", hence $!, is
               meaningful only immediately after a failure:

                   if (open my $fh, "<", $filename) {
                               # Here $! is meaningless.
                               ...
                   }
                   else {
                               # ONLY here is $! meaningful.
                               ...
                               # Already here $! might be meaningless.
                   }
                   # Since here we might have either success or failure,
                   # $! is meaningless.

               Here, meaningless means that $! may be unrelated to the outcome
               of the "open()" operator.  Assignment to $! is similarly
               ephemeral.  It can be used immediately before invoking the
               "die()" operator, to set the exit value, or to inspect the
               system error string corresponding to error n, or to restore $!
               to a meaningful state.

               Mnemonic: What just went bang?
